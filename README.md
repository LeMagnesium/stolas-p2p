# Stolas, a small P2P messager project

Primarily intended as an evolved school project, [Stolas](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolas) focuses on the development of a Network Manager and message interpreter (with its interface) with the objective of making a functional (but maybe not optimized) network communication client in P2P fashion.
