# Stolas, a small P2P messager project

Primarily intended as an evolved school project, [Stolas](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolas) focuses on the development of a Network Manager and message interpreter (with its interface) with the objective of making a functional (but maybe not optimized) network communication client in P2P fashion.

### Todo List (for the hypothetical future of the project)
 - Save the MPile's content and the tuned in channels in the databse
 - Enrich the graphical interface : add a tab which lists our connected peers in details, as well as a counter on the bottom part of the main frame
 - Add a splash screen to display the logo, some licence info, authors, etc
 - An "about" window
 - Some translation systems for the UI
 - A mean of signing messages cryptographically with an identity
 - A mean of tuning into a channel by means of asymmetric key sharing
 - etc..
